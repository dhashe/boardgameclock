# Boardgame Clock

A minimal tool for recording how much time is spent on each player's turn when playing boardgames.

This is a static, three page HTML app that does not communicate with a server or store any data.

I created this for personal use, but you may find it useful as well.

I suggest entering in the names of everyone you regularly play board games with on index.html, and then bookmarking or adding-to-homescreen the turns.html link that you are sent to. That way you won't have to enter in their names every time.
